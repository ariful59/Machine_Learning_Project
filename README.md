# **Machine Learning Project: Predicting Employee Turnover**

## **Overview**

This project addresses the critical issue of employee turnover by developing machine learning models to predict and understand the factors leading to employee attrition. By accurately forecasting turnover, organizations can implement targeted strategies to enhance employee retention, reduce associated costs, and maintain a committed workforce.

## **Project Description**

Utilizing the [HR Analytics dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giripujar/hr-analytics), this project involves:

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Exploring and preprocessing the dataset to identify key features influencing employee turnover.

- **Model Development**:
  - Implementing various machine learning algorithms from scratch, including:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

- **Evaluation**:
  - Assessing model performance to determine the most effective approach for predicting employee attrition.
